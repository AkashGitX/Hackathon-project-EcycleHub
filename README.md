Project Description
EcycleHub is a web application developed in Java that bridges the gap between individuals who wish to donate reusable products and organizations that seek to repurpose them. In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, reusable items such as clothes, electronics, furniture, and books are discarded daily, contributing to environmental waste. At the same time, many NGOs, businesses, and social organizations are in constant need of such items.

EcycleHub provides a sustainable digital platform where:

Public users can donate recyclable products with proper location, name, and contact information.
Organizers can access the donated items, review the submissions, and make arrangements to reuse or distribute them.
By encouraging reuse, EcycleHub supports a *circular economy, reduces landfill waste, and promotes community-driven environmental change. This platform aims to ensure that **nothing goes to waste, and every product gets a *second chance!
